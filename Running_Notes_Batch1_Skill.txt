KAfka:
============================
To initiate kafka on local machine,we needd to follow below steps.
1)Download zookeeper server.
2)make necessary modifications in server config files,if necessary
3)start the server and check wwhther server is running on the specified port.
4)Download Kafka server to any drive except downloads folder.
note: dont launch any server from downloads folder.
5)Make necessary changes to kafka config and launch the kafka server parallely with zookeeper.
=============================
Apache kafka or confluence kafka(https://www.confluent.io/get-started/)
=>Apache kafka is open source and confluence kafka is cloud based and which is commercial for development.fl
confluence comes with 2 types of licensing 1)confluence platform --free community edition
                                           2)confluence platform enterprise---costly
==> apache kafka has limited connectors and confluence has more no of connectors.
==>no inbuilt tools for kafka,but confluence is power packed with multiple tools and GUI is available.
=>security wise confluence is stronger.
=>kafka does not have load balancers, but confluent has inbuilt load balancing.
---------------------------------------------------------
In how many ways can we install kafka?
1)on-premises
2)cloud---for cloud installations,we use AWS,GCP,AZURE,Alibab cloud ,Confluence...etc
3)docker
4)vm
====>
We need a server.
IN IT,we do have 2 types of servers.
1)Web Server-----Nginx,Tomcat,jetty ....etc

Web server is software with below components.
Web server= Http Engine + Catalina container+Jasper container+Middleware services

2)Application server-------Weblogic,jboss,pramathi,Glashfish.......etc
App server is software with below components.
App server= Http Engine + Catalina container+Jasper container+MQq(messsaging queue) container+EJB(Enterprise java beans)
container+Middleware services

browser is called as "User-agent"
>>Http is a stateless protocol.All web browsers use Http/https Protocol.
What is commercial cert in https?

http will not provide security.
Https= http+SSl layer

to enable ssl at server level,we need to use security certificates.There are 2 types of security certificates.
1)self signed: self signed certs are the certs that we are going to create,ie any human can create it manullay using 
java commands.These are not secure.we can use self for local testing.
2)Commercial: certs thats are provided by vendors like go-daddy,verisign,cloudfare,paypal,paytmcerts,CA....etc.
every certificate will have private keys,validity period,security algo and cert-chain,issueirs details.

For production env and for dev ,we need to use commerial.
==============================================>
I wan to start my kafka server?
We had installed offset software for monitoring.
------------------------------>
Connector:A connector is a software which is used for transferring data from source/origin point to destination.

in the market we do have so many connectors.For kafka,we can use "kafka connector".

java connector.For working on differnt types of connectors,you need to learn ESB which 
is Mulesoft,Apache camel,tibco,sap...

ESB is a architecture---Stands for enterprise service bus.ESB comes with some design patterns for
 which vendors like mule,tibco,apachecame up with implementations.
 
 In short is is group of rules ,regulations which are mainly for integrating multiple apps which are heterogenious.

Broker/Mediator: Broker means a node or a server or an instance or machine
Transformation:converting data from one form to another.
Example: xml to json convertion and vice versa
---------------
Producer:any thing which emits or gives data to destination is called as producers.
Consumer:who will accept data.
Queue: queue is a data structure/storage area with the priciple, FIFO---first in first out.
To implement QUEUE ,we need one producer and only one consumer
Message: any thing which is in binary format.Message can be of any format like xml,json,bson...etc
Topic:Topic can store your data temporarily like queue.To implement Topic ,we can have multiple producers and multiple  consumers.

producer----------->QUEUE------------>Consumer
producer----------->TOPIC------------>Consumer1
						  ----------->Consumer2	
						 
Apache kafa follows topic implementation.
==>Cluster: group of brokers/broker instances is called as cluster.
As per the kafka best practices,in a cluster we need have a minimum of 3 brokers or even need to have odd no of brokers
in real time .
->kafka is stateless.So it uses Zookeeper to state management.

Meta data:any thing which describes an object is called meta data.ie its name,shaze,size...etc.
What is Event?
do u have listner?listner is a s/w pgm which responds to events.
Consumer group: group of consumers are called as consumer group.Every group has a name which is userdefined.
Producer group: group of producers are called as producer group.Every group has a name which is userdefined.

use of TCP protocol? it is a standard for secure data transmission between client and server.
kafka uses tcp protocol.

Encryption?
decryption?

can i perform encryption in one machine and decryption in another machine?
ans) no
encryption algo will change from machine to machine.so encryption cannot be done in one  machine and
 decryption cannot be done in another machine.
 
 compressing techniqs: use gzip and deflatter techniqs

replication means data duplication.
Stateless protocol:
when ever we request fb.com/google  from browser,what will happen?
