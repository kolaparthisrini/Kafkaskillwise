kAFKA
=================
JDK
kafka offset
notepad++
zookeeper 
kafka
jdk
eclipse
7zip
============================
To initiate kafka on local machine,we needd to follow below steps.
1)Download zookeeper server.
2)make necessary modifications in server config files,if necessary
3)start the server and check wwhther server is running on the specified port.
4)Download Kafka server to any drive except downloads folder.
note: dont launch any server from downloads folder.
5)Make necessary changes to kafka config and launch the kafka server parallely with zookeeper.
=============================================Day2==============================
Queue: it is a data structure/storage area which works on principle FIFO.

queues will have only one producer and only 1 consumer at a time.

producer--------->Queue------------>consumer
Topic: it is a data structure/storage area/log file.

Organization producer

Data is money

Consumer is employee.

Topics will have any no of  producers and any number of consumers at a time.


Topic and queues are not databases.It will store your data temporarly.
Broker: means a kafka node/machine.
Cluster/chain/group: Group of machines or servers or terminals or nodes
machines can be at same location or in remote location as well.
Https:it is secure protocol.

Https= Http+SSl  layer

when we say about ssl,we need to focus on security certificates.

certificates are of 2 types.
1)self signed: self signed certs are created by us using java.
2)commercial: commercial certs are provided by vendors like godaddy,verisign,desicert,paypal,paytm,...etc.
Note: In production or realtime,we use only commercial certs.No self signed.
self signed are used for learning purpose.

In this certs,we will have private security keys.
kafka  3rd party GUI tools uses https protocls.

replication:replication means duplicating the messages across network.
Consumer: Anything which receives data is called as consumer
consumer group:group of consumers is called as consumer group
Producer: Anything which emits data is called as producer
producer group:group of producers is called as Producer group.
Vertical scaling:increasing no of cpus and memory
Horizontal scaling:increasing more no of machines to existing cluster.
Autoscaling: all cloud providers supports autoscalingie it can do horizonal or vertically automatically
without manual involvement
Encryption and decrytion rules:

Encryption means converting plain text to cipher text is called as encryption.
reverse is called as decryption.

Once the encryption is done in one machine,decryption cannot be done in another machine.

Apache kafka vs confluence kafka:
Meta data: 
Example: login credentials,ip address,its shape,color....etc.any thing which describes an object can be called as meta data.

Table: dextara
column:uname,pwd -string--8,empid--string--primary key constraint name

Data:alphabets,numbers,symbols,characters,...etcdata will be in meaningless format.
Information:processed data which is meaning full is called as information.
tcp:it is n/w protocol for transfering data from client to server securely.
kafka uses tcp protocol.
policy:  set of rules/guidelinees which are  used to controll resources,their access from secure way.
In kafka,kafka came up with security and retension policies.polices in any technology is written in either 
xml or json or bson.
bson is  more advanced than json.
Ways to install kafka:
1)on premises: https://kafka.apache.org/downloads

Always go with GA(general availabilityie making it public) releases.dont uses canary release or beta releases for production environments.
2)confluence kafka cloud
https://www.confluent.io/lp/confluent-kafka/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=ch.sem_br.brand_tp.prs_tgt.confluent-brand_mt.xct_rgn.india_lng.eng_dv.all_con.confluent-kafka-general&utm_term=confluent%20kafka&creative=&device=c&placement=&gclid=CjwKCAiAxvGfBhB-EiwAMPakqmw1ZULbyBl-f_mDJMjTskBk-Vi6opVU9Rjhv0_VrGZghG7BjobyOhoCWB0QAvD_BwE

Apache kafka vs confluent kafka?
common things are both will do same work,same componets.

Apache kafka is open source while onfluent kafka is commercial(confluent community license and enterprise license).
apache kafka is for on-premises,but confluent kafka is for cloud.
Confluent provides more no of tools and connectors by default,where in apache kafka additional things are not provided.s

3)docker--on the top of containers ,we can install.
4)VM---virtual machine
5)other cloud providers--AWS,azure,gcp....etc
============================================================================================
We can start and stop zookeeper and kafka using bat files also.
